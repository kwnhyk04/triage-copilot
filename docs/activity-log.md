## Entries

### 2026-10-14: ElasticMQ message persistence

- Changes: Enabled ElasticMQ `messages-storage` (H2) on a named volume `elasticmq-data` in both compose files; planned a recovery sweeper under step 4.
- Files: infra/elasticmq.conf, infra/docker-compose.yml, infra/docker-compose.prod.yml, docs/todo.md, docs/context.md, docs/memory.md
- Validation: A queued message survived a container restart and a recreate, with its receive count and the redrive policy intact. `make test-int` passes (Jest 2, pytest 9). The merged prod config mounts the volume and publishes no queue port.
- Outstanding: Recovery sweeper (docs/todo.md, step 4).

### 2026-10-14: Prompt 1 completion items

- Changes: Config validation moved to zod and pydantic-settings with one-line startup errors; gitleaks pre-commit hook; production compose override; ElasticMQ probe tests; turbo agent guidance turned off and its AGENTS.md block removed.
- Files: packages/ts-config, packages/py-config, apps/gateway (config, main, drizzle.config), apps/web/src/lib/config.ts, services/agent, services/executor, sim, .pre-commit-config.yaml, Makefile, pyproject.toml, infra/docker-compose.prod.yml, turbo.json, AGENTS.md, README.md, docs/
- Validation: `make lint`, `typecheck`, `test` (Jest 10, pytest 9) and `test-int` (Jest 2, pytest 9) pass. Unset `GATEWAY_DATABASE_URL` or `AGENT_DATABASE_URL` stops startup with exit code 1 and a one-line error. The hook blocked a staged fake token and passed all 116 project files. The merged prod config publishes no Postgres or ElasticMQ ports. `docker compose ps` host ports match the context.md table.
- Outstanding: None.

### 2026-10-14: Step 1 scaffolding

- Changes: Polyglot monorepo (pnpm + Turborepo TS apps and packages, uv Python services and packages), contracts v0 with codegen, pinned infra compose (Postgres + pgvector, ElasticMQ, Toxiproxy, observability profile), per-service Postgres roles, root Makefile. ElasticMQ, TypeScript 6.0.3 and ESLint + Prettier chosen by the user. Fixes from an independent review: gateway CORS and GraphiQL off, agent consumer survives handler errors, gateway DB ping timeout, SWC parses `.ts` without TSX, shared configs hashed by turbo.
- Files: Makefile, package.json, pnpm-workspace.yaml, turbo.json, pyproject.toml, .env.example, infra/, contracts/, apps/, services/, sim/, packages/, evals/, runbooks/, README.md, docs/
- Validation: `make lint`, `typecheck`, `test` (Jest 10, pytest 9), `test-int` (Jest 2, pytest 3), `build`, `migrate` and `codegen` (deterministic) pass from PowerShell and Git Bash. Compose healthy, observability profile included. Every `/healthz` and `/readyz` returns 200 under `make dev`. Traces from gateway and agent reach Jaeger.
- Outstanding: See docs/todo.md.

### 2026-10-14: Plan updated for free-tier models, production readiness, and deployment

- Changes: Switched to free-tier LLMs behind a provider switch, added production-readiness requirements, added steps 9 (review UI) and 10 (deploy).
- Files: AGENTS.md, docs/context.md, docs/memory.md, docs/todo.md
- Validation: Documentation only. No code changed.
- Outstanding: See docs/todo.md.

### 2026-10-13: Project created from template

- Changes: Copied `_project-template`, filled project-specific rules in `AGENTS.md`, added `CLAUDE.md` importing `AGENTS.md`, recorded design in `docs/context.md`, decisions in `docs/memory.md`, build plan in `docs/todo.md`.
- Files: AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md, docs/*
- Validation: Documentation only. No code to test.
- Outstanding: None.
