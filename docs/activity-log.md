### 2026-10-14: Approver credential

- Changes:
  - New required env var `APPROVER_API_KEY`, for the gateway (verifies) and the web server (sends). It is in `.env.example`, and the Makefile passes it only to `dev-ts`.
  - `gateway.yaml` has an `approverKey` scheme (`X-Approver-Key`) on approve and reject, and a 403 response for other credentials.
  - The gateway serves both routes with the approver check, request validation and problem+json errors, through an injected decision store that is a not-found placeholder until step 3.
  - `createGatewayClient` no longer types the decision routes; `createDecisionClient` and the web's `decideAction` handle them. Next transpiles `@triage/ts-clients`. The gateway's DB integration test no longer loads the full config.
  - The reviewer's probe queue was already gone: ElasticMQ holds only `investigations.fifo` and its DLQ.
- Files: contracts/openapi/gateway.yaml, apps/gateway/src (app.ts, app.test.ts, config.ts, main.ts, db.int.test.ts), apps/web (next.config.ts, src/lib/config.ts, decisions.ts, decisions.test.ts), packages/ts-clients/src (gateway.ts, contracts.test.ts), services/agent/tests/test_agent_api.py, services/executor/tests/test_executor_api.py, sim/tests/test_sim_api.py, packages/py-clients/tests/test_clients.py, Makefile, .env.example, docs/
- Validation:
  - Tests:
    - Approve with only `X-API-Key` gets 403, and so does the Alertmanager token.
    - A missing or wrong approver key gets 401 with the challenge.
    - The approver key gets 200 for approve and reject.
    - A bad body or id gets 400; unknown and decided actions get 404 and 409.
    - Agent, executor and sim settings hold no approver key, even when it is set in their environment.
    - The Python clients contain no `/v1/actions` path.
  - `make lint`, `typecheck`, `test` (Jest 27, pytest 25), `build`, `test-int`, `contracts-check` and `contracts-breaking` pass.
  - Live gateway on 4200: `X-API-Key` and bearer got 403, a wrong key 401, the right key 404 (placeholder store), all problem+json, and the key never reached the log. Without the key the gateway exits with `APPROVER_API_KEY is required`.
  - Make probes under sh and cmd.exe: a plain target does not see the key, even from the calling shell; the dev-ts export line does.
  - gitleaks: no leaks in the files with placeholder keys.
- Outstanding: Add `APPROVER_API_KEY` to the local `.env`, since the gateway and web now refuse to start without it. The other credentials and the decision store are in docs/todo.md.

### 2026-10-14: Step 2 contracts

- Changes: Wrote the contracts spec-first. Gateway OpenAPI 3.1 adds `/v1` alerts, investigations, approve and reject, with RFC 9457 errors, rate-limit headers and three security schemes. The agent internal API adds cancel and state. Added versioned message schemas with examples (StepRecorded v1, v2 and a union), and the GraphQL schema with a Relay connection and an `Investigation` subscription. Codegen now produces openapi-fetch clients with timeouts, ajv message validation and web typed documents (TypeScript), plus pydantic models in `py_clients.generated` and httpx2 clients (Python). Codegen wipes its output first. Added `make contracts-check` and `make contracts-breaking` (oasdiff in Docker), and contract tests on both sides. The agent now imports `InvestigationRequestedV1`.
- Files: contracts/, packages/ts-clients (scripts/codegen.ts, src/), packages/py-clients (scripts/codegen.py, src/py_clients/, tests/), apps/web/src/graphql, apps/web/src/generated, apps/web/src/lib/gateway.ts, apps/gateway/src/app.ts and app.test.ts, services/agent (imports), scripts/contracts_check.py, Makefile, pyproject.toml, README.md, docs/
- Validation: `make lint`, `typecheck` (pyright 0 errors), `test` and `build` pass. `make contracts-check` and `make contracts-breaking` pass from Git Bash and from PowerShell (cmd.exe). Negative checks failed as intended: a hand-edited generated file and an unregenerated schema edit failed `contracts-check`, and removing `/readyz` failed `contracts-breaking` (`api-path-removed-without-deprecation`). Real-socket check: `fetchWithTimeout` passes POST bodies and aborts with `TimeoutError`. `make test-int` passes (Jest 2, pytest 9).
- Review fixes (independent review, 0 high and 5 medium findings):
  - The MessageGroupId is the group id, since SQS rejects Alertmanager group keys.
  - The Python `GatewayClient` lost approve and reject.
  - Bad action kinds are now rejected in both languages, and a type-level enum parity check was added.
  - `contracts-breaking` now also fails on edited or deleted message versions.
  - oasdiff runs with `--network none` and only `.git` and `contracts/` mounted.
  - `/graphql` is documented as needing X-API-Key.
  - 401 responses carry `WWW-Authenticate`.
  - The response `Health` schemas allow unknown members.
  - The TS gateway client type excludes `/v1/alerts`.
- Review fix validation: everything above re-passed (Jest 21 including ts-clients 11, pytest 21) from both shells. Removing a GraphQL enum value failed `tsc` at the parity tuple. A scratch git repo confirmed the message-version rule: an edited or deleted version fails, and a new or staged file passes. The oasdiff container sees only `.git` and `contracts` and cannot resolve hosts.
- Outstanding: No service serves the new routes or enforces their credentials yet. Per-kind action parameters and the report message are open (docs/todo.md). GraphQL query resolvers are step 9. The question of a separate credential for approve and reject was settled by the approver credential entry above.

### 2026-10-14: ElasticMQ message persistence

- Changes: Enabled ElasticMQ `messages-storage` (H2) on a named volume `elasticmq-data` in both compose files; planned a recovery sweeper under step 4.
- Files: infra/elasticmq.conf, infra/docker-compose.yml, infra/docker-compose.prod.yml, docs/todo.md, docs/context.md, docs/memory.md
- Validation: A queued message survived a container restart and a recreate, with its receive count and the redrive policy intact. `make test-int` passes (Jest 2, pytest 9). The merged prod config mounts the volume and publishes no queue port.
- Outstanding: Recovery sweeper (docs/todo.md, step 4).

### 2026-10-14: Prompt 1 completion items

- Changes: Config validation moved to zod and pydantic-settings with one-line startup errors; gitleaks pre-commit hook; production compose override; ElasticMQ probe tests; turbo agent guidance turned off and its AGENTS.md block removed.
- Files: packages/ts-config, packages/py-config, apps/gateway (config, main, drizzle.config), apps/web/src/lib/config.ts, services/agent, services/executor, sim, .pre-commit-config.yaml, Makefile, pyproject.toml, infra/docker-compose.prod.yml, turbo.json, AGENTS.md, README.md, docs/
- Validation: `make lint`, `typecheck`, `test` (Jest 10, pytest 9) and `test-int` (Jest 2, pytest 9) pass. Unset `GATEWAY_DATABASE_URL` or `AGENT_DATABASE_URL` stops startup with exit code 1 and a one-line error. The hook blocked a staged fake token and passed all 116 project files. The merged prod config publishes no Postgres or ElasticMQ ports. `docker compose ps` host ports match the context.md table.
- Outstanding: None.

### 2026-10-14: Step 1 scaffolding

- Changes: Polyglot monorepo (pnpm + Turborepo TS apps and packages, uv Python services and packages), contracts v0 with codegen, pinned infra compose (Postgres + pgvector, ElasticMQ, Toxiproxy, observability profile), per-service Postgres roles, root Makefile. ElasticMQ, TypeScript 6.0.3 and ESLint + Prettier chosen by the user. Fixes from an independent review: gateway CORS and GraphiQL off, agent consumer survives handler errors, gateway DB ping timeout, SWC parses `.ts` without TSX, shared configs hashed by turbo.
- Files: Makefile, package.json, pnpm-workspace.yaml, turbo.json, pyproject.toml, .env.example, infra/, contracts/, apps/, services/, sim/, packages/, evals/, runbooks/, README.md, docs/
- Validation: `make lint`, `typecheck`, `test` (Jest 10, pytest 9), `test-int` (Jest 2, pytest 3), `build`, `migrate` and `codegen` (deterministic) pass from PowerShell and Git Bash. Compose healthy, observability profile included. Every `/healthz` and `/readyz` returns 200 under `make dev`. Traces from gateway and agent reach Jaeger.
- Outstanding: See docs/todo.md.

### 2026-10-14: Plan updated for free-tier models, production readiness, and deployment

- Changes: Switched to free-tier LLMs behind a provider switch, added production-readiness requirements, added steps 9 (review UI) and 10 (deploy).
- Files: AGENTS.md, docs/context.md, docs/memory.md, docs/todo.md
- Validation: Documentation only. No code changed.
- Outstanding: See docs/todo.md.

### 2026-10-13: Project created from template

- Changes: Copied `_project-template`, filled project-specific rules in `AGENTS.md`, added `CLAUDE.md` importing `AGENTS.md`, recorded design in `docs/context.md`, decisions in `docs/memory.md`, build plan in `docs/todo.md`.
- Files: AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md, docs/*
- Validation: Documentation only. No code to test.
- Outstanding: None.
